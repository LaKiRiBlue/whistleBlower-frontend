It is also accessible at any time and from any location and provides a central contact point for whistleblowers. When reporting, whistleblowers fill out a case report form which requests important information about the case. Whistleblowers are free to leave their personal data. The reporting system creates a mailbox through which the case manager can communicate further with the whistleblower. If the compliance manager receives a report, he or she examines the case and initiates further steps.</div>}
